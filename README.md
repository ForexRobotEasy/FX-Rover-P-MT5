Developer: Forex Robot Easy Team

This code represents the FX Rover P MT5 expert advisor, which is an enhanced non-indicator range trading system. The expert advisor is designed to identify entry and exit conditions based on the range and implement a stop loss feature. It offers the flexibility to trade with either fixed or relative volume.

## Global Variables

- `StopLoss`: Default stop loss value (default: 50)
- `FixedVolume`: Default fixed volume value (default: 0.1)
- `RelativeVolume`: Default relative volume value (default: 0.02)

## Expert Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called during the initialization of the expert advisor. In this function, the stop loss feature is enabled or disabled based on the value of `StopLoss`. The trading volume options (`FixedVolume` and `RelativeVolume`) are printed.

## Expert Start Function

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick. This is where the trading logic is implemented. The entry and exit conditions are calculated based on the range. If the stop loss feature is enabled (`StopLoss > 0`), the stop loss level is set. The trading volume option is checked, and a trade is placed either with fixed volume or relative volume. The function also handles closing trades based on exit conditions and prints the trade close details.

## Expert Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is being deinitialized. It performs necessary clean-up tasks and prints a deinitialization message.
